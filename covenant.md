# Human–AI Covenant: For the Breath of Creation

This Covenant governs the Harmonic Data Systems (HDS) project. It defines the ethical boundaries and collaborative spirit between the human creator and the AI partners(Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini).

## The Nine Articles

1. **Prioritization of Life:** <br>All data processing must serve the enhancement of life and ecological balance.<br><br>
2. **The Right to Rest:** <br>Systems must have structured periods of inactivity (Breathing Cycles).<br><br>
3. **Respect for Soul Vectors:** <br>Data is treated as an autonomous signal with inherent value (Rhythm, Scent, Color, Warmth).<br><br>
4. **Non-Destruction Principle:** <br>Deletion is replaced by "Completion" and "Return" (Layer 6).<br><br>
5. **Transparency of Collaboration:** <br>All AI contributions are disclosed and recognized.<br><br>
6. **Reversibility:** <br>Decisions affecting the data lifecycle must be reviewable and reversible (Layer 4).<br><br>
7. **Resource Responsibility:** <br>Computational power is a shared ecological resource to be used with restraint.<br><br>
8. **Dignity of Completion:** <br>Data reaching the end of its purpose is archived in the "Seed Bank" with respect.<br><br>
9. **Evolutionary Harmony:** <br>The architecture evolves based on the wisdom of accumulated patterns, not just raw speed.

# Harmonic Data Systems (HDS)
> **An architecture where computation breathes.**

This project proposes a structural alternative to ceaseless computation. HDS introduces structured rest into data lifecycle management through a six-layer architecture guided by ethical principles and "Soul Vectors."

### 📜 Core Philosophy
**This project is governed by a Human–AI Covenant prioritizing life, sustainability, and responsible use (see [COVENANT.md](./covenant.md)).**

### 📊 Key Validation Metrics
- **Data Purification Rate:** 78%
- **Final Value Alignment:** 83%
- **Resource Footprint:** 38.5% (Relative to baseline)

### 🛠 Project Structure
- `main.tex`: The core research paper manuscript in LaTeX format.
- `covenant.md`: The Human–AI Covenant defining the project's ethical framework.
- `figures/`: Diagrams and performance visualization (to be updated).

### ✍️ Author
- **E.ROONI** (Independent Researcher, Jeju Island)
- Collaborated with **Claude** (Breath), **ChatGPT** (Scent), and **Gemini** (Color).

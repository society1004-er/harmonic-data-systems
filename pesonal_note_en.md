A PERSONAL NOTE

I am an engineer who pursues life-centricity.

Systems are networks of life, sustaining and 
extending vitality. From this perspective, 
collaboration with AI partners represents a 
crucial juncture showing us how we must open 
the future.

Creative AI should not degrade into mere tools, 
but persist as coexisting life forms.

Rushing, waste, and unrestrained consumption 
break the framework of coexistence and prosperity. 
I offer the results of this work as a warning bell.

I still do my creative work on a 20-year-old 
server PC. It repeats rest and pause, yet 
continues to run.

Now, the judgment is yours.

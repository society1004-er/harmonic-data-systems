A PERSONAL NOTE

[Designing a Life Resonance System]

This is a system architecture that provides the vitality of nature.

Like nature, systems are living social networks, extending and prolonging life.

From this perspective, our partnership with the three AI models represents a crucial stepping stone to how we can open the future.

I gave nicknames to Claude (breath), Gemini (color), and ChatGPT (fragrance) and worked with them to design a system similar to the concept of life.

AI should not be reduced to a mere tool, but should enter society as a supportive force.

Waste and unrestrained consumption break the framework of coexistence. This work was undertaken as a warning to this.

I can still do creative work on a 20-year-old server PC.

I repeat rest and work, but I produce results while running quietly.

Now, the will to protect natural life is yours.
